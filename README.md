# pret-decomp-resources
This repository is a collection of tools/software, scripts and tutorials to help you create your (decomp) romhack. Feel free to contribute to this list if, for example, something is missing!

Tools/Software which are consistently being updated are not going to be in one of the folders on this repository because each time it gets an update, I will have to recompile it and upload it here on github and I dont want to do that. So here is a list of all links which correspond to their github repository (_NOTE: I dont own most/any of the tools/software, scripts and/or Tutorials! All credit goes the creators who spent multiple hours in creating any kind of those resources!_):
